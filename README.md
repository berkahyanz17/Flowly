So here are my first PySide6 Project
so many i have to fix but i decide to upload it now and guess what
im using git pull for the first time

Sadly i didnt build my code by myself
GPT pro for the first half
Claude for the last half
and free GPT for my github commit hhehe

Note:
If there any bug or breaches please let me know
Its still so messy (just look at the file), so
All feedback are open

Commit, git tysm
Thank you so much

Edit:
I've improved the structure
and modified some file to make it installable
